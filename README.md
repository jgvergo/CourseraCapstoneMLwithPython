# CourseraCapstoneMLwithPython
Capstone project for Coursera class called Machine Learning with Python

In this python notebook I apply all the classification algorithms learned in "Machine Learning with Python" course from Coursera.

I load a dataset using Pandas library, clean and prepare the data, apply multiple algorithms, evaluate the accuracy of each algorithm and find the best one for this specific dataset.
